# CS3110Project1

This project accepts inputs of the format of java floating point numbers. 
It then outputs these numbers as doubles in the commandline.
It does not accept signed doubles.
It also does not differentiate between d or D and f or F in deciding what type to output. It will always output a double.

This project utilizes a DFA using a custom dataStructure, which can be found in the linkedMap.java file.
If a string cannot be converted using regular java format, the project will out put "rejected"

USAGE:
to use this project, run the main method in the driver file, and then proceed to providing input via the commandline.
In order to quit running this file, you can use the q or Q inputs.
